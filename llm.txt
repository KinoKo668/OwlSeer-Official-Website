# OwlSeer

## Overview
- OwlSeer is an AI foresight platform for TikTok creators.
- Core promise: "Know What Will Grow Before You Post."
- Core value: analyze 30+ weighted predictive signals and return practical decisions before publishing.
- Primary pain points solved:
  - random posting with no feedback loop
  - late trend participation on already saturated topics/sounds
  - disconnected workflow across strategy, diagnosis, scheduling, and scripting
- Outcome: creators move from guesswork to a closed-loop, data-backed content system.

## Key Capabilities
- Signal Intelligence (30+ weighted signals):
  - 12 engagement signals, 10 trend signals, 8+ audience signals.
  - Produces account-level signal profile, risk flags, and growth priorities.
- Agent-driven execution chain:
  - Account diagnosis agent -> root-cause analysis + fixes.
  - Goal/planning agent -> weekly content roadmap + cadence.
  - Script agent -> hook/body/CTA scripts with rationale.
  - Scheduling agent -> time-window and content-slot planning.
- Trend and hotspot engine:
  - Trend knowledge graph + trend lifecycle modeling for rising-topic detection.
  - Hotspot timing recommendations (enter/exit windows, saturation risk).
- Credits and cost governance:
  - External pricing uses a 4x cost buffer; internal risk control uses a 6x model.
  - All AI usage is unified under Credits, including Copilot conversations.
- Data and trust boundaries:
  - Uses official TikTok API with OAuth 2.0 read-only authorization.
  - No password storage; no DM/draft/posting control access.
